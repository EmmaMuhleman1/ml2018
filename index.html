                <p>I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rosenberg-5982414">David
                    Rosenberg</a>, and I'll be the instructor for DS-GA 1003 / CSCI-GA 2565 in
                    Spring 2018. This is a temporary page to give you some information before the
                    course begins. This year's class will be similar to <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2017/">last
                    year's class</a>, though there will be some modifications in the selection of the more advanced topics.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CDS Grad Students</strong>: You should be able to register for DS-GA 1003 once registration opens.
                    </li></ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer Science Grad Students</strong>: You should be able to register for CSCI-GA 2567 (also this course) once registration opens.  If assistance is needed, please contact <a href="mailto:laugel@cs.nyu.edu">Katie Laugel</a>.
                    </li></ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other PhD Students</strong>: Your adviser can request registration for this course for you, if it is relevant to your PhD research.  Please send requests to  <a href="mailto:kangeles@nyu.edu">Kathryn Angeles</a> and <a href="mailto:dr129@nyu.edu">David Rosenberg</a>.   We can then either register you for the course or add you to the waitlist if the course is full when registration opens on November 13. But please also consider the comments below about course preparation and requirements. I encourage you to go through the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/prereq-questions/prereq-self-assessment.pdf">Prerequisite Questionnaire</a>, just to make sure you have the preparation.
                    </li></ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other Students</strong>: The student categories listed above have priority, and there are usually relatively few available slots after their registration.  But in principle, I'm happy to have anybody in the class who is well-prepared and will have the capacity for the very demanding workload this class imposes.  To assess your preparedness, please read carefully the Prerequisites and Requirements section below.
                    </li></ul>

                <h3>
                    <a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites and Requirements</h3>

                <p>Perhaps the best way to get a sense of how prepared you will be for the course <strong>material</strong> and <strong> workload</strong> is to read the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ml2017/#lectures">slides and lecture notes from  Week 1 of 2017</a> and complete <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Archive/2017/Homework/hw1.zip">Homework #1</a> (give yourself one week).  This will also give you a jumpstart on the course, because we will have almost the same first homework in 2018.</p>

                <p>You can also self-assess your preparation by filling out the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/prereq-questions/prereq-self-assessment.pdf">Prerequisite Questionnaire</a>.  If you would like to ask my opinion on whether you are sufficiently prepared for the class, please send me your completed questionnaire. More details on the prerequisites are given below:</p> 

                <ul><li>
                    <strong>Programming</strong>:  You'll need to be comfortable with Python and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, at least. Knowing how to generate plots and tables to summarize results will be necessary as well.  For a crash course in Python for data science, the first few chapters of <a href="http://amzn.com/149190142X">Data Science from Scratch</a> seem like a good bet.  For more in-depth coverage, including the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> library, <a href="http://amzn.com/1449319793">Python for Data Analysis</a> is worth a look.  While pandas won't be particularly useful for the homework assignments, it's highly recommended for doing basic data analysis in practice and will be useful for your course projects.</li></ul>
                        <ul><li>
                            <strong>Math</strong>: Your best bet would be to review the notes from the prerequisite class <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/%7Ecfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall15/notes.html">DS-GA 1002</a>.  The priorities would be a review of matrix algebra (be comfortable with reading and manipulating expressions involving matrices, vectors, and norms), gradients, and basic probability theory (expectations, independence, Law of Large Numbers, conditional distributions, and conditional expectations).  You'll also need to be comfortable with some basic analysis, such as taking limits and computing derivatives from first principles. But I consider pretty much every part of the 1002 syllabus (from fall 2015 -- in subsequent years it was split into two courses) to be an important part of a data scientist's toolbox. </li></ul>
                        <ul><li>
                            <strong>Machine Learning</strong>: You should at least be familiar with the basic notions of supervised learning, overfitting, and cross-validation. The course is designed to follow <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/ds-ga-introduction-data-science-fall-2015/">DS-GA 1001</a>, and many of your peers will have taken this class.  At a bare minimum, you'll need to be familiar with all concepts in these <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Lectures/01.black-box-ML.pdf">Black Box Machine Learning</a> slides.  For a more in-depth background, the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-data-analytic-thinking/dp/1449361323">Data Science for Business</a> is highly recommended.  It covers many important issues about mapping real-world problems into machine learning problems, which we don't cover much in this course.  To get a jump start into practical machine learning, I highly recommend the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do">Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a>.  If you've never done any machine learning before, it's worth working through the Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the first two chapters of that book, available on <a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml">GitHub</a>. It will be helpful when you get to your projects.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                        <a id="textbooks" class="anchor" href="#textbooks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Textbooks</h3>

                    <p>The following 3 textbooks will serve as good references at different times during our course:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">The Element of Statistical Learning</a> (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman)
                            <li><a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms</a> (Shalev-Shwartz, Ben-David)
                                <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a> (Bishop)
                    </ul>
                    <p> The first two books are available as PDFs for free from the publishers.  As a free alternative to Bishop's book above, you might consider the following:
                        <ul>

                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This year's course lectures and homeworks will be similar to last year's.  If you want to hit the ground running, it would not be a waste of time to start working on last year's homework assignments now.</li>
                            <li>The homework writeups must all be submitted as PDF or HTML files.  There are many ways to do this, but it might be worth your time to figure out a way you're comfortable with before the class starts.  For parts of the homework that are math heavy, you may want to use <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> or write directly in <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.  You can also write math directly in a Jupyter notebook, which can be convenient as well.<br>
